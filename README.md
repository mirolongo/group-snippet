Snippet Manager
This is a project that allows users to view, add, like, dislike, and delete code snippets. It consists of a web application with a simple and interactive interface, connected to an external API for data manipulation.

Features
Fetch Snippets: Users can retrieve the best or latest snippets from the external API by clicking the "Fetch Best Snippets" or "Fetch Latest Snippets" buttons, respectively.

Add Snippets: Users can add new snippets by clicking the "Add New Snippet" button, filling in the snippet's title and content in a modal, and clicking "Save".

Like and Dislike Snippets: Users can like or dislike snippets by clicking the corresponding reaction buttons ("üëç Like" and "üëé Dislike"). This updates the snippet's rating in the API.

Delete Snippets: Users can delete snippets by clicking the trash icon ("üóëÔ∏è"). This removes the snippet from the list and the API.
